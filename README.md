This repository includes all my internship tasks, which I performed at the Artificial Technology Center (AITeC), Islamabad. First I learned and implemented image processing techniques, including edge detectors and matchers. Build a convolutional neural network with model checkpoints to save best-tuned weights. As last exercise, I trained a custom YOLO model for detection of vehicles, including cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles.
